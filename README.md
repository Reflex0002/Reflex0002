Currently, I serve as a Quantitative Analyst at Texas Undergraduate Computational Finance, where I contribute to weekly market reports, quantitative research, and strategy backtesting using Python, JavaScript, and Pandas.

Previously, I built automation software targeting limited-release products such as sneakers, collectibles, and other niche merchandise.
My work involved reverse engineering, system design, and developing and analyzing network request flows, authentication mechanisms, and REST APIs, alongside full-stack implementation of cross-platform desktop applications.
